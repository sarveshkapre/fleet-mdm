# Roadmap

## Near term
- More agent-side exporter examples (macOS: FileVault, OS update settings; Linux: disk encryption, kernel version) plus schema validation guidance.
- Reporting/scaling UX: add `report` and `drift` filters (`--policy`, `--device`) to reduce noise at scale.
- Optional read-only web dashboard for inventory + compliance + evidence verification status.

## Later
- Optional read-only web dashboard
- Agent sidecar for scheduled inventory uploads
- Script execution via signed bundles

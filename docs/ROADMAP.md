# Roadmap

## Near term
- Security defaults: stricter evidence redaction posture for high-risk identifiers and explicit trust-boundary docs.
- Exporter parity: Linux secure-boot and additional schema guidance for macOS/Linux collection fields.
- Packaging docs: Homebrew/Nix install plus checksum verification guidance.
- More agent-side exporter examples beyond the current macOS/Linux baseline (macOS: firewall, OS update deferrals; Linux: secure boot, disk layout) plus schema validation guidance.
- Optional read-only web dashboard for inventory + compliance + evidence verification status.

## Later
- Optional read-only web dashboard
- Agent sidecar for scheduled inventory uploads
- Script execution via signed bundles

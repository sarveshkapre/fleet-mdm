# Roadmap

## Near term
- Extend evidence redaction controls beyond inventory facts (for example, policy YAML `raw_yaml` redaction).
- Inventory ingest dedupe/upsert by `device_id` for correctness at scale.
- Add compliance pipeline integration outputs (for example, `report --format junit`).

## Later
- Optional read-only web dashboard
- Agent sidecar for scheduled inventory uploads
- Script execution via signed bundles

# Roadmap

## Near term
- Doctor enhancements: optional integrity checks and maintenance guidance for `VACUUM`/freelist actionability.
- Normalize invalid `--format` behavior across CLI commands with consistent exit codes/messages.
- Config defaults support for `--db`, report defaults, and evidence output defaults.
- More agent-side exporter examples beyond the current macOS/Linux baseline (macOS: firewall, OS update deferrals; Linux: secure boot, disk layout) plus schema validation guidance.
- Optional read-only web dashboard for inventory + compliance + evidence verification status.

## Later
- Optional read-only web dashboard
- Agent sidecar for scheduled inventory uploads
- Script execution via signed bundles
